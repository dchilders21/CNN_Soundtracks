										<h2>ABOUT THE EPISODE</h2>
									</div>
									<div className="t-center">
										<p>The death of Martin Luther King, Jr. marked a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement, a moment of reckoning for African Americans in the United States. After the mourning, the community gathered its strength to continue King’s fight, inspired by the fiery protest songs of Nina Simone, the black power anthem of James Brown, and the extraordinary voice of Aretha Franklin.</p>

										<p>The continued struggle for civil rights has been a long and uneven battle since 1968, but the spirit of resistance has been kept alive in the music, from Stevie Wonder’s campaign to establish a Martin Luther King national holiday to Kendrick Lamar’s searing protest song that became an anthem for the Black Lives Matter Movement. The music in this episode both celebrates the strength and solidarity of the African American experience while reminding us how far we still have to go.</p>

									<h4>Various (Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Mahalia Jackson, Peter Yarrow to name a few of the best known)</h4>
									<div className="line-separator"></div>

									<p>Though frequently credited to Pete Seeger, who published a version of the song in 1947 in his folk music magazine People’s Songs, <b><i>“We Shall Overcome”</i></b> had previously entered the national consciousness as a labor anthem. Sung on picket lines throughout the south, it was associated most notably with a mid-forties strike by North Carolina cigarette workers and at least one earlier strike involving miners in Alabama. Yet even those roots and the tune’s melody trace to an earlier and lyrically similar gospel song, <b><i>“I’ll Be Alright,”</i></b> and it’s that church spirit and its’ soulful yearning – transformed into the collective “we” by the labor movement – that made <b><i>“We Shall Overcome”</i></b> the natural choice of protesters, beginning with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in 1960. Says civil rights activists and U.S. Congressman John Lewis, who was badly beaten during the march to Selma: <i>“It gave you a sense of faith, a sense of strength, to continue to struggle, to continue to push on. And you would lose your sense of fear. You were prepared to march into hell’s fire.”</i> </p>

The trio, created two years earlier by their manager, music promoter Albert Grossman – who later oversaw the careers of Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin as well – was an unusual hybrid, meant to deliver both the earnest political and social topics associated with earlier folk musicians, and to succeed commercially as a nightclub and concert act.

								<div className="line-separator"></div>

								<p>Inspired by the March on Washington, Chicago songwriter Curtis Mayfield penned the gospel-inflected <b><i>“People Get Ready”</i></b> for his trio, the Impressions. As in many of the popular church songs Mayfield heard growing up, such as guitarist Sister Rosetta Tharpe’s <b><i>“This Train,”</i></b> Mayfield used the notion of a train ride to signify both a journey to redemption and a sense of religious community. Indeed, in a 1993 radio interview, Mayfield suggested that the song’s biblical imagery had simply come to him as a result of his upbringing in the church, when it was a matter of course to hear both gospel and “the preachings of my grandmothers and most ministers when they reflect from the bible.” Though a pop star – after leaving the Impressions, Mayfield enjoyed his biggest hits with the soundtrack to the classic African-American gangster film, <i>“Superfly,”</i> Mayfield never lost touch with his spiritual roots. Until his death in 1999 as the result of a freak stage accident, Mayfield remained a songwriter whose topics were ever and always hope and justice. </p>

								<h4>Nina Simone</h4>
								<div className="line-separator"></div>

								<p>Dubbed “the High Priestess of Soul,” Nina Simone drew on an extraordinary wealth of music traditions including classical, gospel, jazz and pop to create her own unique style as a singer and pianist. Julliard-educated, Simone took her stage name in homage to the French actress Simone Signore and to hide her career as a nightclub singer from her father, a Carolina preacher. A passionate performer and volatile personality with a deep commitment to African-American self-determination, Simone was the creator of two of the most outraged songs of the era. Her composition  <b><i>“Mississippi Goddamn”</i></b> – written, she said, in a “rush of fury, hatred and determination” – was spurred by two despicable events in the summer of 1963: the murder of civil rights activist Medgar Evers in Jackson, MS., and the Alabama bombing of Birmingham’s 16th Street Church that killed four young black girls and blinded a fifth.  Though not an adherent to Dr. King’s philosophy of non-violence, Simone leant her support to numerous civil rights actions, including the march from Selma to Montgomery, where she performed 
								<b><i>“Mississippi Goddamn.”</i></b> Three days after Dr. King’s assassination, Simone and her group recorded a live album dedicated to him that including <b><i>“Why (The King of Love is Dead)”</i></b> written by bassist Gene Taylor. Always independent and idiosyncratic, Simone spent her later years as an expatriate, living at various times in Europe, Liberia and Barbados before settling in the south of France. </p>

								<h2>“Say It Loud (I’m Black and I’m Proud)” </h2> 
						

							<h4>James Brown</h4>
							<div className="line-separator"></div>

							<p>The undisputed anthem of black power and black pride, <b><i>“Say It Loud (I’m Black and I’m Proud)”</i></b> was both an enormous hit and one of the rare popular works in any medium that managed to both encompass and move a moment. Though he certainly wasn’t the lone or even an early proponent for replacing “negro” with “black” in the American lexicon, Brown’s record so correctly, forthrightly, and irresistibly captured the trajectory of African-American consciousness as to immediately consign “negro” to the dustbin of history. The ebullient, funk-charged song, featuring a call-and-response with a chorus of kids rounded up from a nearby restaurant, topped the R&amp;B charts for six weeks – a mighty achievement in a year that saw Brown score nine different hits.  An outspoken advocate for black empowerment, Brown’s greatest moment may have been his historic performance at the Boston Garden on the night Martin Luther King, Jr. was murdered: in offering a riveting concert and appearing on television that night, Brown has been credited with preventing the widespread rioting that gripped many other American cities. </p>

								<h2>“Living for the City”; “Happy Birthday”</h2> 
						

							<h4>Stevie Wonder</h4>
							<div className="line-separator"></div>

							<p>Released in August, 1973 as part of the album <b><i>“Innervisions,”</i></b>  <b><i>“Living for the City”
							</i></b>  became an instant classic: a condemnation of the cruelly failed dream of an African-American rebirth through migration to the north. Told as a narrative, a young man raised in the rural deep south leaves family and hardship behind in a bid for a new beginning in the city, only to become fodder for con men and hustlers, his story ending not with enlightenment or economic hope but jail. For Wonder, who could be acerbic about the unchanging status of African-Americans (<b><i>“You Haven’t Done Nothing”</i></b> ), (<b><i>“Living for the City”</i></b>  was particularly caustic. Yet his celebratory “Happy Birthday” – both a tribute to Dr. King and the spearhead of a successful movement to honor him with a national holiday – was Wonder at his optimistic and focused best: changing the world one note at a time. </p>

						<h4>Public Enemy</h4>
						<div className="line-separator"></div>

						<p>Commissioned by Spike Lee for his film, <i>“Do the Right Thing,”</i> no record showcased hip hop’s ability to express the inner city’s frustrations in the Reagan era as incisively as Public Enemy’s, <b><i>“Fight the Power.”</i></b> Cooked at a steady rolling boil, with words by group leader Chuck D and a thick stew of samples running the gamut from vocal group the Dramatic to James Browns’, <b><i>“Say It Loud”</i></b>  to pioneering DJ Afrika Bambaataa, the record evoked nothing so much as the hot Brooklyn night portrayed in the film, the air filled with music old and new from apartments and passing cars. A call to hold power accountable, the record fairly seethes with anger and impatience and a palpable sense that patience is a thing of the past. Indeed, the record found a specific later life: in 1989 it was played in the streets of Miami as a celebratory song after a policeman was convicted of shooting a black motorist and spurring a riot. As its author, Chuck D termed the song Public Enemy’s “most important record.”</p>

						<h4>Sam Cooke</h4>
						<div className="line-separator"></div>

						<p>Sam Cooke was never more himself than on his unsurpassed American psalm, <b><i>“A Change is Gonna Come.”
						</i></b> Though a gospel singer who had “crossed over” into pop and nightclub work, Cooke had been paying close attention to the folk revival of the early ‘sixties and was particularly moved by Bob Dylan’s <b><i>“Blowin’ in the Wind.”</i></b> “A black guy should have written that song,” Cooke told his manager, Allen Klein. “I should have written that song.” Thus inspired, Cooke turned to his gospel roots for the song’s inspiration, which seems to come from the story of Exodus – a powerful metaphor for a life of slavery and wandering in America. A song of spiritual transcendence with a soaring, angelic vocal, the original recording was donated to an album benefiting the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the organization closely associated with Dr. King. </p>

							<h2>“Alright”</h2> 
					

						<h4>Kendrick Lamar</h4>
						<div className="line-separator"></div>

						<p>Rarely has a song captured the zeitgeist as elegantly as <b><i>“Alright.”</i></b> Crafted by rapper Kendrick Lamar off a hook by Pharrell Williams with a breadth of allusions referencing both Alice Walker novels and Public Enemy records, it was intended as a street-savvy paean to perseverance, a message of hope and optimism studded in the face of difficulties. While <b><i>“Alright”</i></b> was nominated for Song of the Year at the Grammys, won the award’s rap categories, and topped many 2015 critics’ polls, its remarkable success as a pop phenomenon couldn’t have predicted its embrace as the de facto song of the Black Lives Matter Movement, picked up and chanted by young protesters. Indeed, its picture of a frustrating, violent world mitigated by a life-affirming joy and faith in oneself led one commentator to call <b><i>“Alright”</i></b> the new <b><i>“We Shall Overcome,”</i></b> and the B.E.T. network to suggest it was a modern black national anthem.   In that context, can it be just a coincidence that the roots of <b><i>“We Shall Overcome”</i></b> trace back to an earlier gospel tune entitled <b><i>“I’ll Be Alright”?</i></b> </p>
